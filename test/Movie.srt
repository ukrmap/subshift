3
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:33,406
The Red Door.

4
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:40,288
"We don't need no education!"

5
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,343
Yes you do.

6
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:43,127
You've just used the double negative.

7
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:51,885
Notice anything?

8
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:53,696
- What?
- Yes.

9
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,068
Your eyes, something's wrong
with your eyes.

10
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,665
No... I have a new cup.

11
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:59,016
What's wrong with my eyes?

12
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:00,797
It's not very distinctive, is it?

13
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:02,495
How's anyone supposed to know
it's yours?

14
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:04,120
There's a picture of me on it.

15
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:06,409
No, there isn't!

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,611
- Yes there is.
- No there isn't!

17
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,079
- Moss!
- Yes there is.

18
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,591
I'm sick of my things going walk about.

19
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:13,900
With this picture,

20
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:17,684
everyone knows that a certain Mr. Moss
might be looking for his cup...

21
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,375
There is nothing on the cup!

22
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:22,353
Wrangle with him and you'll find
your handful my friend.

23
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:23,540
Wrangle! With who?

24
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:24,983
There's no one there!

25
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,675
- Morning.
- Morning.

26
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,138
Did you have a nice week-end?

27
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:31,388
- It was alright, thanks.
- Not you!

28
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,385
I did too.

29
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:35,165
Nice scarf.

30
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,936
- I'm not wearing a scarf.
- Not you, Moss!

31
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,496
Notice anything new about Moss?

32
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:42,856
His eyes?

33
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,459
What is wrong with my eyes?

34
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,138
No, he has a new cup.

35
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:47,864
It's the talk of the office.

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,936
Yes, I think I read about it in Hits.

37
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:52,989
Receptionist 3rd floor,
Gloria what's-her-name...

38
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:55,214
Have you seen her baby?

39
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,332
I didn't even know she was pregnant.

40
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:58,619
She was onto here!

41
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:01,472
Yeah, I thought she was stealing
office equipment.

42
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,114
That's how I got that monitor home.

43
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,148
- Do you want to seat here?
- Thank you.

44
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,804
- What?
- Ask me where it is...

45
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:24,161
- Where what is?
- The picture.

46
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,466
Where is the picture, Moss?

47
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:28,935
It's on the base, Roy.

48
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,655
OK, well, let's see it then!

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,196
Sure, I pour hot water all over myself,
and we all have a good chuckle.

50
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:36,974
Everyone except muggins here.

51
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,885
Show you in a minute.

52
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:42,999
Can I ask you two a question?

53
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,557
Please, Christ, yes!

54
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:46,504
Wait, wait. One moment, wait.

55
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,498
Ok. Go.

56
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:53,843
How can you two live like this?

57
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,228
- How can you two...
- Don't google the question Moss!

58
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,060
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,812
It's so disgusting in here.

60
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,635
I mean I know nobody comes down here,

61
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:06,218
but it doesn't mean you have to live
like animals, you know...

62
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:08,085
I mean for a start
you could clean that window

63
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:09,553
and you'd have a bit of light in here.

64
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:10,668
What window?

65
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:11,971
That one up there.

66
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,422
Yeah, that's not a window.

67
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:14,679
Yes it is.

68
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:17,277
Get it clean, you'll have
some light in here.

69
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:19,348
I think that we have plenty of light...

70
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,370
light to be doing fine!

71
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,821
I mean look at that CD tray.

72
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,692
Isn't that important,

73
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:34,021
when you'd like to actually put CDs
in there at some point?

74
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:35,885
Well, yes, ideally, but

75
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,653
I haven't the heart to move them.

76
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,446
I mean, how did that even happen?

77
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:47,719
Ok. Now, I'm curious.

78
00:03:48,626 --> 00:03:50,208
Give us a look at the picture then.

79
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:51,330
What picture?

80
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:52,857
The picture on the cup.

81
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,101
Right!

82
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,408
Behold!

83
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,675
There's nothing there!

84
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:04,205
What?!

85
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:06,450
This isn't my cup!

86
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,866
What is that?

87
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:18,904
Goat's cheese salad?

88
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,259
You don't like goat's cheese?

89
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,990
I don't like goat's anything!

90
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,230
I don't like goats...

91
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:28,611
being involved in any stage
of the food production process.

92
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:32,852
Would I blow everyone's mind
if I ate dessert first?

93
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,452
What are you eating anyway?

94
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,027
It's  a bucket of fried chicken.

95
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,341
You know, it comes in a real bucket now.

96
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:45,660
Tell me,

97
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,940
what's behind that red door?

98
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:53,214
Nothing.

99
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,829
Well, there must be something behind it.

100
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:57,141
There's nothing behind the red door,
Jen.

101
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:58,674
- Well then I can just go...
- No Jen!

102
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:00,955
It's just a boring old store room,
that's all.

103
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,065
It's just a store room where we keep
the snibbits.

104
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:05,697
What's a snibbit?

105
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,074
It's a kind of planch.

106
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,257
A planch for the computers?

107
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,918
Yes. Computer planch.

108
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:13,947
Well, if it's a store room,

109
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:16,352
- you can store some of this stuff.
- No! Jen, Jen!

110
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:19,077
Look, I know that you wanna make
your mark down here and,

111
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:21,898
and that's really sweet, but,

112
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,570
you can't just go messing around
with the snibbits door room,

113
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:26,749
willy-nilly.

114
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:30,797
You... You can't upset the whole harmony
of the place.

115
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,191
Harmony! What harmony?

116
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,745
Look,  I know that the place
looks like a bit of a mess,

117
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,232
but it's actually a very delicate
ecosystem.

118
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,872
Everything is connected.

119
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,839
It's like the rainforest.

120
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,479
You change one thing,

121
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:54,968
even the tiniest bit,

122
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:58,296
and the whole rainforest dies.

123
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:03,814
You don't want the rainforest to die, do you?

124
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,198
No, I really don't want
the rainforest to die.

125
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:09,080
That's what will happen
if you open the red door.

126
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,069
Hello, I.T., have you tried
turning it off and on again?

127
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,943
Ok, but are you sure
that it's plugged in?

128
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,972
Ok, well I'll be up in a minute.

129
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,365
What was that about?

130
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:26,656
Just a girl on four.

131
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,774
Oh, a job?

132
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:28,875
You gonna go?

133
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,730
Yeah. In a while.

134
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:31,904
It can wait.

135
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,851
But why can it wait?
She probably needs to get on,

136
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:35,209
she needs her computer, you know.

137
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:37,428
Yeah well, I am reading a comic.

138
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,843
I knew it.

139
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:41,212
Every time I used to phone I.T.
in my last job

140
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:43,936
it's a good couple of hours
before someone got to me.

141
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,462
That is how we do it.

142
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,228
You can't go up straight away

143
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:48,344
or they'll all expect it.

144
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:49,576
You're killing the rainforest!

145
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:51,027
Stop saying that!

146
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,845
Look there's more than that:
me and this girl,

147
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:53,656
I asked her out once,

148
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,946
she said no, it all got
a little bit embarrassing

149
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,449
and ever since then, whenever I go up,

150
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:00,766
she treats me like I'm some sort of
sexually frustrated cretin.

151
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:05,158
Get up there now, please.

152
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,036
You're not the head of this department.

153
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,762
No, I'm relationship manager.

154
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:10,276
I'm the one you gets the complaints.

155
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,621
I'm the one who gets in trouble.

156
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,152
I'm the one whose name is on the line...

157
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,098
Oh God! All right,

158
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:16,752
I will go up just to shut you up.

159
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:20,199
Watch her!

160
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:43,605
For God's sake!

161
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,559
There's someone under here.

162
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:56,691
Yes!

163
00:07:57,571 --> 00:07:58,757
Hello!

164
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:00,447
Hello?

165
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:09,555
Did you get it fixed?

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,438
Oh, yeah.

167
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:12,633
Well, left him to it.

168
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,236
- Just can't have him in sight.
- Yeah.

169
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:16,146
Do what you need and just go.

170
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:32,388
What are you laughing at?

171
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,532
This flipping circuit board, Jen,

172
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:39,836
Some chump has run the data line
right through the power supply.

173
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,921
Amateur  hour!

174
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,510
I've got tears in my eyes.

175
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,312
Roy's stuck under a desk.

176
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,326
Stuck under a desk?!

177
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:58,103
Yes. It is an unusual text, isn't it?
It's not just me?

178
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,152
No, it's unusual.

179
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:02,605
I'd best investigate.

180
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,842
Yes.

181
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,407
You investigate.

182
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:07,291
I'll hold the fort.

183
00:09:53,312 --> 00:09:55,253
Listen, I'm really sorry
about your hand.

184
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:58,374
Oh, don't worry about it.
I must have cut it when I swooned.

185
00:09:58,422 --> 00:09:59,838
I startled you a bit.

186
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,296
I didn't know there were anyone else
down here.

187
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,054
I thought it was just the three of us.

188
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,339
I often work at nights so, perhaps
that's why you haven't seen me.

189
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:09,619
Gosh, it's very cold in here, isn't it?

190
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:11,474
Air conditioning.

191
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,136
Keep these things cool.

192
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,431
Yes, what are they?

193
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,745
I've no idea.

194
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:19,243
They have put me in charge of them.

195
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:20,576
Moss and Roy.

196
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:22,605
I don't know their names.

197
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:26,123
I mean,

198
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:28,801
I don't know any of these stuff
even does.

199
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:30,647
What's going on there?

200
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:33,468
I don't know.

201
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:35,488
Is it good that it's doing that?

202
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:38,503
Usually, it doesn't do that.

203
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:40,764
And I think I should tell them, but,

204
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,542
but often I just look away.

205
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,515
And this one:

206
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:46,887
Flash.

207
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,124
Flash.

208
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:49,303
Flash.

209
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,404
Then wait for it.

210
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:51,583
Nothing for a while.

211
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:53,320
Here it comes.

212
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:55,948
Double flash.

213
00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:58,306
Brilliant.

214
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:01,764
It's obvious you are going mad.

215
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,121
So, let me get this straight.

216
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:06,112
You stay down here all the time.

217
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:09,714
I pop out occasionally
when I have to get supplies.

218
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:13,482
And you don't know why you're here,

219
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:15,009
or what you do.

220
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:16,206
Correct.

221
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:19,617
So this is your job?
This is what you want for a career?

222
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:20,989
No.

223
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,700
You don't understand.

224
00:11:22,777 --> 00:11:25,308
I'm not here because...
I want to be here.

225
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,564
This is...

226
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,805
This is my punishment.

227
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,181
You  see, I used to be Denholm's
second in command.

228
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,843
Do I amaze you?

229
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:40,545
So, how did you end up down here?

230
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:44,545
That's the question I've been
asking myself for 4 long years.

231
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:48,501
Oh I... couldn't help noticing
that you're bleeding.

232
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,301
- Yes. No it's fine it...
- Just let me...

233
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,960
- Please I can help.
- I'll deal

234
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:53,901
with myself at home
but the risk is, honestly....

235
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,945
Oh  my...

236
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:55,931
Oh my God.

237
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,002
Please, excuse, excuse me,
what are you doi...

238
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,727
Get off me! Get...

239
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,008
Thank you.

240
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,361
That should clear up nicely.

241
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:13,047
Yes, there was a time
when things were very different.

242
00:12:22,953 --> 00:12:25,474
<i>I was one of Reynholm Industries'
top guys.</i>

243
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,658
<i>You should have seen me,
I was magical.</i>

244
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,724
<i>Here's me saying some pretty
important stuff</i>

245
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:31,570
<i>to a group of people circled
around me.</i>

246
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,536
<i>In a boardroom,
I was a wizard.</i>

247
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,946
<i>A punchy character.</i>

248
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,240
<i>Here's me with a graph.</i>

249
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,747
<i>Things were moving fast.</i>

250
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:44,593
<i>So fast, my career was advancing
by leaps and bounds.</i>

251
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,385
<i>Adam saw greater things for me.</i>

252
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,679
<i>They were crazy heady days.</i>

253
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,964
<i>It seemed like these days
would last forever.</i>

254
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:55,973
<i>But it all changed.</i>

255
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:01,731
So, what happened?

256
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,760
It's quite a long story actually.

257
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,866
Really? Don't worry about it then.

258
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,339
Oh my good gracious me, look at that!

259
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:43,918
Quick!

260
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,207
What is it?

261
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,773
I can't explain it.

262
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,928
You're just going to have to come
over here,

263
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,362
and look out this window for a while.

264
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:54,753
Whatever it is, we're not interested.

265
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,202
Well. I have to say you're missing out.

266
00:13:58,636 --> 00:13:59,589
Fine.

267
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:02,955
Jiminy!

268
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:04,095
Jones!

269
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,802
Look, the nature of the things

270
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,191
that is happening has changed...
slightly,

271
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:10,827
rendering it yet more interesting.

272
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,071
Someday, I will tell my kids about this.

273
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,885
But you can't even tell us...

274
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,919
How are you gonna tell your children?

275
00:14:17,954 --> 00:14:21,664
Oh, you have no...
interest in the world.

276
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:31,974
Are you sure it's okay to come out?

277
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:34,013
Yeah, don't you worry about those two.

278
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:36,308
And listen Richmond,
I've always wanted to know yeah,

279
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,920
why do you never see
any Cockney Goths?

280
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:40,582
That's you cheerful.

281
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:43,432
It's spoiled for the rest of us.

282
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:46,286
And how come you never see
Goths driving cars?

283
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:47,851
We drive cars...

284
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,281
We're just like you really...

285
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,194
except that we listen to
Cradle of Filth.

286
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,499
Cradle of Filth,
I presume that's a band.

287
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:57,847
It's not literally a cradle of filth?

288
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,242
Oh no. That would be horrible.

289
00:15:01,561 --> 00:15:02,786
Cradle of Filth are actually

290
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:05,703
one the best contemporary
dark-wave bands in the world.

291
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:09,294
I'll never forget the first time
I heard them.

292
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:15,428
Changed my life.

293
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,649
Blew my mind.

294
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:20,722
I was lucky I discovered them
when I did!

295
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,586
Because it was around that time that

296
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,059
things started to go wrong
for me at work.

297
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,798
I don't know what happened.

298
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:29,696
Suddenly, people just weren't
returning my calls.

299
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:32,188
In my strategy meetings,

300
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,773
they'd seemed distracted.

301
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:35,367
Distant.

302
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,835
I couldn't put my finger on it

303
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,623
but something was wrong.

304
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,574
I'll tell you.

305
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,806
It was good to have
the Filth to come home to

306
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,332
after another disappointing day.

307
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,400
You've got to help Roy!

308
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,274
Richmond's out of his room.

309
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:50,903
He's not in his room,
he's supposed to be in his room.

310
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,641
Why is he out of his room?

311
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:56,979
Well, he's gotta come out
and play with us for a while.

312
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:58,564
But the rainforest and...

313
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,056
What's wrong with you Moss?

314
00:16:01,597 --> 00:16:03,646
Roy's stuck underneath a lady's desk.

315
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:05,118
What! Still?!

316
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:07,178
Look, I know that normally
this would be very funny

317
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:09,546
but he's been under there too long
for reasonable explanation.

318
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:12,090
That woman looks down, she's going
to assume he's a desk rabbit.

319
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,150
- What's a desk rabbit?
- I just made that up.

320
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:16,814
But that's probably going to be

321
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,438
what they'll sort of call
people like Roy.

322
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:20,390
But Roy is not a desk rabbit,
he's my best friend.

323
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:23,110
Unless you do something so tumble you,
me and Tim Burton over there.

324
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:25,942
What can I possibly do? I...

325
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,691
Look, she could look under there
any minute.

326
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,983
- It could already be too late.
- I don't know what to do...

327
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:32,251
You're relationship manager,
that falls under relationship.

328
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,591
Alright, alright.

329
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:34,858
Just shut you up.

330
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:40,810
Hello Richmond.

331
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,317
How are things?

332
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:43,549
Oh you know.

333
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:44,824
Not brilliant.

334
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,658
He's supposed to be in his room.

335
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:07,920
There's a builder outside,
taking off his shirt.

336
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:10,539
- Like in ads?
- Yeah, like in ads...

337
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,508
- Easy one downstairs?
- They're fine, yeah.

338
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,776
I left Moss and Richmond in charge.

339
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:28,974
Good, well Moss...

340
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:30,952
Richmond!
He's not out of his room, is he?

341
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:31,821
Yeah.

342
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,397
What did I say about the red door?
I said don't open the red door!

343
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,012
It was the only thing that I asked you!

344
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,262
What have you got against him?

345
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:38,233
Just don't like him.

346
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:40,368
Oh God, you're just like
the rest of them,

347
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:43,368
the people that turn their backs on him
as soon as he became a Goth.

348
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,602
He obviously hasn't told you
about the funeral.

349
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:49,171
I think that you should ask him
about the funeral.

350
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:57,280
Hello Denholm.

351
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,062
Hi Jen.
I'm just enjoying this cup of tea.

352
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,040
Brilliant!

353
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,453
How you doing Jen?

354
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,695
Yeah. Just to say...

355
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,708
I met Richmond.

356
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:11,770
I see.

357
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,082
It's not for me to say Denholm, but

358
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:18,797
it sounds like you two
had a good relationship at one point.

359
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:21,510
You should speak to him.

360
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:23,427
I'll thank you to keep out of this Jen.

361
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:26,182
- Goths are people to.
- Enough!

362
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,191
There's absolutely no point to anything.

363
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:40,898
You're right, no point, it's all futile,
can't even find my cup.

364
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,518
Try to look on the bright side.

365
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,931
Ah!  The bright side!

366
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:48,806
Sometimes, you just think

367
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,878
what would actually change
if I just killed myself.

368
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:53,915
You're right.

369
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,140
I could just kill myself.

370
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,433
And it'd be so easy, wouldn't it?

371
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,933
So very, very easy.

372
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,167
Richmond!

373
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:06,180
Get back to your room!

374
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:08,084
What's the point of sending him
back to him room,

375
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,223
what's the point of anything?

376
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,016
Come on, get brush! Come on!

377
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:12,484
But she said I could come out.

378
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:14,750
Well you can't come out.
You're bringing everyone down.

379
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:16,456
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, he is!

380
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,272
- Come on!
- Thank you.

381
00:19:18,427 --> 00:19:19,934
Okay well then, tell her,

382
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,223
why they sent you down here.
Tell her what you did.

383
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,736
I didn't do anything,
I don't know why I'm down here.

384
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,880
So Denholm just amorted you
for nothing, did he?

385
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,590
No, he changed.

386
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:31,663
After his father died.
I don't think he ever fully recovered.

387
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,194
From the moment I saw him
at the funeral,

388
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,425
I could tell there was something
different.

389
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,130
Bloody good of you to come, thanks.

390
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,270
Thanks.

391
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:52,203
Bloody good service, wasn't it? Yeah?

392
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:55,255
- Thank you.
- Watch your bloody hand!

393
00:19:58,308 --> 00:19:59,412
I'm so sorry.

394
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,315
Here.

395
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,783
It's Cradle of Filth.

396
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,261
It got me through
some pretty bleak times.

397
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,793
Try track 4, Coffin Fodder.

398
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:11,904
It sounds horrible,
but it's actually quite beautiful.

399
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:26,367
Relationship manager.

400
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:29,961
Yes. Yes of course.

401
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,028
First thing tomorrow.

402
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,592
That was Denholm.

403
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:38,872
He wants to see you.

404
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:52,738
What is it?!

405
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,101
I can't believe you want me back.

406
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,647
You've got Jen to thank for that.

407
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,029
Her words the other day,
moved me deeply.

408
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,425
Very deeply indeed.

409
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,280
Really? What did she say?

410
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,575
Like I remember!

411
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:12,280
Point is: it's the effect of her words
that's important.

412
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,761
I now know that treating someone
differently

413
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:17,283
just because of the colour
of their skin is wrong.

414
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,032
I don't see why things can't get back
to the way they were.

415
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:22,917
I just don't know what to say.

416
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,493
You're back with the big guys Richmond!

417
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:25,134
Great!

418
00:21:25,157 --> 00:21:26,954
That's if you're prepared
to take me on again.

419
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:28,625
You know how demanding I am.

420
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:30,790
Stop it.

421
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:32,256
You know how changeable I can be.

422
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:33,984
Yes Mr. Denholm.

423
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,279
Call me Denholm!

424
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:36,786
All right, thanks Denholm.

425
00:21:37,404 --> 00:21:39,508
No no. I don't like that.
Don't do it again.

426
00:21:39,895 --> 00:21:40,919
All right, sorry.

427
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,987
In fact, I've changed my mind
about the whole thing.

428
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:44,764
What? You mean I have to stay down here?

429
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:45,575
Yes!

430
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,218
And leave me alone you goblin!

431
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:52,206
Oh well. I suppose it's not quite so bad

432
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,324
now that I don't have
to stay in that room.

433
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:55,696
Yes, yes.

434
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:57,725
Well, we're happy to have you.

435
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,182
My milky lens has popped out.

436
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:04,487
Don't step on it.

437
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:06,359
You've got... to help me find it.

438
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:10,397
Oh, actually,
I think it's just popped round the back.

439
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:12,272
It does that sometimes.

440
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:13,914
Come on.

441
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:16,233
Come on. Come on fellow.

442
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,073
Come on.

443
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,159
There.

444
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:25,418
How about that then?

445
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,104
That looks great!

446
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,046
Told you it was a window.

447
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,111
Bloody lens.

448
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:42,558
I'd... really ought to...

449
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,683
Actually, I'm gonna...

450
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,543
Thank God.

451
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:54,499
At least, everything is back to normal.

452
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,572
As long as no one goes through
that door.
